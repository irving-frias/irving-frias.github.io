## My Journey

My career in web development began over 6 years ago, and I've since specialized in the Drupal ecosystem. What started as backend development has evolved into a comprehensive full-stack expertise, allowing me to deliver complete solutions from architecture design to final implementation.

I'm passionate about solving complex problems with elegant solutions, whether it's building custom modules, architecting multisite platforms, or creating modern component-based themes.

## Technical Philosophy

I believe in **pragmatic development** — using the right tool for the job while maintaining clean, maintainable code. My approach combines:

- **Component-driven development** with SDC (Single Directory Components)
- **Progressive enhancement** for accessibility and performance
- **Automation** to reduce repetitive tasks and ensure consistency
- **Continuous learning** to stay current with evolving technologies

## Core Expertise

### 🎨 Frontend Development
- **Modern Theming:** SDC, component-based architecture, reusable patterns
- **CSS/Styling:** Sass, Bootstrap 4/5, Tailwind CSS, responsive design
- **Build Tools:** Gulp, Webpack, automation workflows
- **Documentation:** Storybook, Pattern Lab for design systems

### ⚙️ Backend & Architecture
- **Drupal Development:** Custom modules, APIs, integrations
- **System Architecture:** Multisite, multitenant solutions
- **Content Strategy:** Paragraphs, Layout Builder, multilingual setups
- **Performance:** Caching strategies, database optimization

### 🔄 DevOps & Workflow
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipelines, automated testing
- **Deployment:** Docker, automated workflows
- **Collaboration:** Git workflows, code review processes
- **Performance Tuning:** Monitoring, optimization techniques

## Beyond Code

When I'm not developing, I'm usually:

- **Learning** new technologies and methodologies
- **Mentoring** other developers in the Drupal ecosystem
- **Writing** technical documentation and sharing knowledge

## Currently Exploring

- **Advanced React patterns** and state management
- **TypeScript** for type-safe JavaScript development
- **Astro** for content-focused static sites (like this portfolio!)
- **Performance optimization** techniques for large-scale applications

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in hearing about challenging projects, innovative solutions, or opportunities to collaborate. Whether you're looking for a developer, need architectural advice, or just want to discuss technology, feel free to reach out.
